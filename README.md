# SMART operators
This is a Python file for the SMARTr operators, which are aggregation operators in the topic of Fuzzy Logic.
The project is ongoing, it will be updated occasionally.
Please, note that it is possible that there are some errors, you can signal them in the proper section.
The SMART-or computes ,from a list of vertices of a polygonal functions, the vertices of the Fuzzy number obtained through the SMART-or.
The SMART-and computes the output of the SMART-and operator applied to two triangular Fuzzy numbers.
